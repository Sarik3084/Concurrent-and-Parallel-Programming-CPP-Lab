//Note:Here if we don't use mutex lock there is switching between two threads without the completion 
//of first process
//output without mutex lock 
//Enter the value to search1	2	3	3	6	8	9
//here without the completion of linear search ,bubble sort is executed
//Thus mutex lock locks the critical section/resources so only one thread can be executed at a time
//After its completion next thread executes 	
//If successful, the pthread_create() function returns zero. Otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
